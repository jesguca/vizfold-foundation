# VizFold Gateway

Prototype workspace for the VizFold science gateway.

This subtree currently has two distinct tracks:

- `apps/executor`: the active Rust core for persistence and execution-domain work.
- `apps/workbench`: a disconnected Next.js frontend prototype that still runs on mock data.

The frontend is useful for UX iteration, but the Rust executor is the main implementation path for core data model, database, and execution workflow development.

## Repository Structure

- `apps/`: runnable gateway applications.
- `apps/executor/`: Rust service and core library. Contains SeaORM entities, migrations, services, seed setup, and the current Axum adapter.
- `apps/workbench/`: Next.js workbench prototype for browsing concepts and mock flows. Not wired to the Rust executor yet.
- `docs/`: gateway-specific notes, architecture sketches, future UX ideas, and backlog material.
- `docs/architecture.md`: high-level architecture notes for the gateway direction.
- `docs/future-ux.md`: product and interaction ideas that are not implemented yet.
- `docs/todo.md`: working backlog and rough implementation notes.
- `docs/img/`: diagrams and supporting images used by the docs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: lightweight branching and contribution guidance for this fork.

## Current Development Status

- The Rust executor is the primary active implementation path.
- The workbench is still a UI prototype with static mock data.
- The workbench does not own persistence and is not connected to the executor yet.
- SeaORM migrations are part of the Rust executor startup flow.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS or later
- npm
- Git
- Rust toolchain with `cargo` and `rustc`

Recommended version checks:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
cargo -V
rustc -V
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd vizfold-foundation/science-gateway
```

## Workbench Development

Run the frontend prototype from `science-gateway/apps/workbench`:

```bash
cd apps/workbench
npm install
npm run dev
```

The workbench will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Notes:

- This app currently uses mock data only.
- No database setup is required for the current workbench prototype.
- The older generic Next.js README language about alternate package managers or Vercel deployment is not important for current gateway development.

## Executor Development

Run the Rust executor from `science-gateway/apps/executor`:

```bash
cd apps/executor
cargo run
```

The current HTTP health endpoint is available at [http://127.0.0.1:3001/health](http://127.0.0.1:3001/health).

### Executor CLI

The `vizfold` CLI provides a development workflow for inspecting and operating persisted OpenFold runs. Run it from `science-gateway/apps/executor`:

```bash
cargo run --bin vizfold -- seed
cargo run --bin vizfold -- list models
cargo run --bin vizfold -- list targets
cargo run --bin vizfold -- list profiles
cargo run --bin vizfold -- list runs
```

Queueing is model-specific because a run does not exist yet. Once queued, operations are run-centric:

```bash
cargo run --bin vizfold -- queue-run openfold ...
cargo run --bin vizfold -- execute-run <run-id>
cargo run --bin vizfold -- register-artifacts <run-id>
cargo run --bin vizfold -- show run <run-id>
```

`seed` is safe to repeat and ensures the local OpenFold backend, `local-openfold` target, and matching invocation profile are available. The CLI uses `DATABASE_URL` when set and otherwise uses the SQLite default described below. For the complete local OpenFold setup and an end-to-end CLI workflow, see [DEMO.md](DEMO.md).

### Installing the CLI

Build the development binary from `science-gateway/apps/executor`:

```bash
cargo build --bin vizfold
./target/debug/vizfold --help
```

On PowerShell, run the built binary with:

```powershell
.\target\debug\vizfold.exe --help
```

To install only the CLI binary into Cargo's bin directory (typically `~/.cargo/bin`) so it can be invoked directly, use:

```bash
cargo install --path . --bin vizfold
vizfold --help
vizfold seed
```

Use `cargo install --path . --bin vizfold --force` to update an existing installation. This is currently a development/demo CLI: the seeded local OpenFold profile assumes the checked-out repository layout, so build and run it against that checkout rather than treating it as a general standalone installed application.

### Database and SeaORM Migrations

The executor uses SQLite and SeaORM migrations.

Current behavior:

- Default database URL: `sqlite://data/vizfold.db?mode=rwc`
- Database file location, when using the default URL: `science-gateway/apps/executor/data/vizfold.db`
- Parent directories are created automatically if they do not exist.
- SeaORM migrations run automatically during executor startup.
- Default seed records are inserted on startup if they are missing.

Create the database and apply migrations by starting the executor:

```bash
cd apps/executor
cargo run
```

That startup path will:

1. open or create the SQLite database file,
2. enable SQLite foreign keys,
3. run SeaORM migrations,
4. seed default model backend and execution target records.

To use a different SQLite file, set `DATABASE_URL` before running the executor.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "sqlite://data/vizfold-dev.db?mode=rwc"
cargo run
```

Bash:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite://data/vizfold-dev.db?mode=rwc"
cargo run
```

The `vizfold seed` command also opens the database and applies migrations before seeding. There is not currently a migrations-only CLI command; use either executor startup or `vizfold seed` for local development setup.

### Resetting an Existing Development Database

If you already ran an earlier version of the Rust executor, you may have an older SQLite schema on disk.

The most likely symptom is an error like:

```text
no such column: model_backends.version
```

Why this happens:

- SeaORM records applied migrations in the `seaql_migrations` table.
- If a local database already marked the original migration names as applied, SeaORM will not rerun them automatically.
- That means an older `vizfold.db` can keep the old table shape even after the code expects the new schema.

This is a Rust executor migration-state issue. It is not caused by the disconnected Next.js workbench itself. The frontend does not currently manage this SQLite database.

For the current development-only setup, the safest fix is to remove the existing executor database and let the executor recreate it.

If you are using the default database path:

PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item .\apps\executor\data\vizfold.db
cd .\apps\executor
cargo run
```

Bash:

```bash
rm ./apps/executor/data/vizfold.db
cd ./apps/executor
cargo run
```

If you set a custom `DATABASE_URL`, delete the SQLite file referenced by that URL instead, then start the executor again.

After reset, executor startup will recreate the DB, apply the current SeaORM migrations, and seed the default records again.

Current expectation:

- this reset guidance is appropriate for local development
- no production-safe migration path exists yet for carrying an older executor DB forward automatically

### Tests

Run the Rust executor tests from `science-gateway/apps/executor`:

```bash
cargo test
```

These tests exercise the in-memory SQLite path, SeaORM migrations, and the core registration/run/artifact services.

## What May Be Obsolete

The previous gateway README referenced directories such as `packages/schemas`, `packages/adapters`, and `examples` as if they were part of `science-gateway`. Those entries do not exist in the current `science-gateway` subtree and should not be treated as active local structure here.

Likewise, the workbench should not be described as integrated with the backend yet. The current accurate state is:

- frontend prototype in `apps/workbench`
- Rust core and persistence work in `apps/executor`
- no real executor-to-workbench wiring yet
